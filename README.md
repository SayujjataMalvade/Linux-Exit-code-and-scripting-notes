# Linux Exit Codes & Shell Scripting Notes

This repository contains my personal learning notes while studying Linux,
Shell Scripting, and DevOps fundamentals.

The goal of this repo is not to memorize everything, but to build a
reference that helps me debug issues faster and understand system behavior
in real-world scenarios.

Topics covered:
- Linux exit codes
- Signals and process termination
- How DevOps engineers use exit codes
- Shell scripting best practices
